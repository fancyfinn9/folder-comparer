# A simple folder comparer

How it works:
1. You run the script and provide the two directories
2. Hashes are gotten for each file in the two folders
3. The script compares the files and hashes in the folders
4. All information is output in output.txt

This script won't tell you exact differences between folders but is handy for quickly checking for modified files.
